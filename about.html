  <p class="intro-text">
    I am passionate about technology and its transformative impact on the world. From an early age, my curiosity about how digital systems work led me to train as a systems engineer and specialize in cybersecurity. With over a decade of experience, I have built my career researching threats, designing strategic defenses, and leading security operations in enterprise and cloud environments.
  </p>
  <p class="intro-text">
    My passion does not stop at the technical. I am motivated to explore emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent automation, and cyber investigation. I firmly believe that innovation and defense must evolve together, which is why I devote part of my time to studying new technological advances, understanding how attackers think, and developing creative solutions for the challenges of the future.
  </p>
  <p class="intro-text">
    I enjoy complex challenges: from analyzing a sophisticated cyberattack to understanding how a new device can affect privacy or critical infrastructure. I closely follow new technological trends because I believe that knowledge is the best tool for anticipating risks and building a more secure and ethical future.

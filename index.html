<div class="highlight-box">
  Results-driven Information Security Analyst with 10+ years of experience in cybersecurity, threat analysis, incident response, and compliance. I am an expert at conducting vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and implementing robust security measures. I am skilled in SOC operations, cloud security (AWS, Azure, GCP), and regulatory frameworks including ISO 27001, NIST, and PCI-DSS. Proven ability to collaborate cross-functionally and communicate security strategies to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Spanish and English.
</div>

      <p>I am passionate about technology and its transformative impact on the world. From an early age, my curiosity about how digital systems work led me to train as a systems engineer and specialize in cybersecurity. With over a decade of experience, I have built my career researching threats, designing strategic defenses, and leading security operations in enterprise and cloud environments.</p>
      <p>My passion does not stop at the technical. I am motivated to explore emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent automation, and cyber investigation. I firmly believe that innovation and defense must evolve together, which is why I devote part of my time to studying new technological advances, understanding how attackers think, and developing creative solutions for the challenges of the future.</p>
      <p>I enjoy complex challenges: from analyzing a sophisticated cyberattack to understanding how a new device can affect privacy or critical infrastructure. I closely follow new technological trends because I believe that knowledge is the best tool for anticipating risks and building a more secure and ethical future.</p>
